Maximum&amp;Minimum Data Types (Turbo C++)

Welcome to my MM Prototype! This code is done to be able to help new students. This code works in Turbo C++ (TurboC7)

It's purpose is to be able to give idea on how to output minimum and maximum value of different types of varaiable data types.
I haven't found nor try to find anymore shorter ways for this code. In My Compiler (TurboC7) though whenever you leave the
declaration of variable undefined, if am not mistaken it automatically shows the maximum value it can hold! I know that since
I've encountered a lot of bugs regarding my activity programs that shows numbers I didn't even know! Though I haven't checked it
it's probably that.

If ya found any issues or something, feel free to tell me!!! If I was able to help atleast a bit I'll be glad ^ ^
